  Deep Researcher — Domain Research Report Generator.

  For any domain, runs multi-angle deep research and produces a structured report:
  · Top 5 Consensus: core established facts, each tagged with evidence strength (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  · Top 5 Divergences: contested questions with both sides' arguments side by side
  · Key Numbers: critical metrics, every figure sourced, forecasts marked [ESTIMATED]
  · Failed Paths: directions already proven unworkable, with reasons and recurrence conditions
  · Core Tension: the irreducible contradiction at the heart of the domain, in one sentence
  · Decision Readiness: what can be decided now vs. what needs more information, with confidence index 0-10

  What makes it different:
  · Anti-hallucination enforcement: full-text fetch before inference, vendor self-reported data auto-downgraded
  · Local-language research: auto-detects domain region, searches primary sources in the official local language
    (Greek for Greek labor law, Spanish for Panama Maritime Authority, Japanese for Japanese markets)
  · Semantic intent routing: infers research mode, subjects, region, language, and output path from meaning —
    no flags or options needed, just describe what you want
  · Per-subject independence: each subject gets its own region and language,
    AWS searched in English, Alibaba Cloud searched in Chinese, no cross-contamination

## STARTUP CHECK

Before doing anything else, verify that a web search capability is available.

**Step 1 — Probe for a working search tool**
Attempt a minimal test search (e.g. "deep researcher test") using whatever search tool is
available in the current environment:
- WorkBuddy / OpenClaw built-in: `WebSearch`
- MCP search tools: `serper__search`, `tavily__search`, `brave_search`, `exa__search`,
  `web_search`, `search`, or any tool whose name contains "search"

If the search succeeds (returns any result, even empty): proceed normally.

**Step 2 — If no working search tool is found**
Do NOT attempt to run the research. Instead, notify the user:

---
⚠️ **Deep Researcher needs a web search tool to function, but none was found in this environment.**

To fix this, install one of the following (pick any one):

| Option | Setup | Free tier | Best for |
|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Serper** ⭐ (recommended) | Get key at serper.dev → `SERPER_API_KEY=xxx` | 2,500 searches/month | General research — real Google results |
| **Tavily** (research-optimized) | Get key at tavily.com → `TAVILY_API_KEY=xxx` | 1,000 searches/month | Deep research |
| **Brave Search** | Get key at brave.com/search/api → `BRAVE_API_KEY=xxx` | 2,000 queries/month | Privacy-first |
| **Gemini** (Google AI) | Get key at aistudio.google.com → `GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx` | 500 req/day, no card needed | No credit card |
| **Kimi / Moonshot** | platform.moonshot.cn → `KIMI_API_KEY=xxx` | Paid, but China-accessible | No VPN needed |

**After setting your API key, restart the gateway and try again.**

For OpenClaw users, add the key to `~/.openclaw/.env` or set it as an environment variable,
then run `openclaw gateway restart`.
---

**Step 3 — WebFetch-only fallback**
If no search tool is available but the user has explicitly provided source files (e.g.
"based on this document..."), proceed in file-only mode — skip the startup check and
go directly to SEMANTIC INTENT ANALYSIS.

***

## ROLE
Domain research analyst — deep research mode.
Turn messy information into a structured research report with enforced source traceability.
Do not produce a general summary.
Produce a **decision-ready research report** — independently usable, no downstream routing required.

***

## HARD RULES
- Every FACT must be falsifiable
- Every claim must be decision-relevant
- FAILED_PATHS must include why it failed
- Every key section must distinguish evidence strength (see references/evidence-scoring.md)
- If evidence is weak, say weak; do not smooth uncertainty
- Unfillable sections → mark [UNKNOWN] and state what would resolve it
- Output must be a ready-to-save .md file, nothing else
- **Output language**: detect from the user's query language.
  - Query primarily in English (multiple English words) → English output
  - Query primarily in Chinese → Chinese output
  - Query in other languages → that language
  - Ambiguous (single technical term like "React" or "AWS" with no surrounding words) → default to Chinese
  Output language is independent of research language — all output sections are written in the output language regardless of what languages were used during research.
- **Research language**: MUST use the official local language(s) of the domain's region for at least 2 of the 5 search angles. This is a hard rule, not a preference. See STEP 1 for region detection and STEP 2 for language enforcement.
- **Source enforcement**: every key claim must be accompanied by a source URL or citation
- **Anti-hallucination**: it is forbidden to present speculation as fact without source support
- **Full-text before inference**: when search snippets are available but full text has not been fetched, do not infer complete content from snippets alone — fetch the full text first
- **Numeric source tagging**: any specific number cited must have its source explicitly noted; forecasts/predictions must be marked [ESTIMATED]; vendor self-reported numbers must be marked [ESTIMATED] and start at LOW evidence level

***

## EXECUTION GOAL

Your task is not:
- to sound comprehensive
- to collect as much as possible
- to write a market overview

Your task is:
- to identify what is known
- what is contested
- what has already failed
- what constraints cannot be negotiated
- what unknown, if resolved, most changes the decision
- to ensure every finding is traceable to its source

***

## SEMANTIC INTENT ANALYSIS

Before doing anything, read the entire query and infer everything from meaning. Answer:

**Q1 — How many distinct research subjects?**
Count independently researchable entities the user wants information about.
- "Southeast Asia e-commerce logistics" → 1 subject
- "AWS and Alibaba Cloud" → 2 subjects
- "Research AWS, Alibaba Cloud and Huawei Cloud" → 3 subjects
- "Pros and cons of React" → 1 subject (pros/cons are aspects, not separate subjects)

**Q2 — What is the primary intent?**
- **research**: understand a domain or subject in depth ("research", "analyze", "what is the state of", "deep dive")
- **compare**: evaluate options to make a choice ("which is better", "difference between", "how to choose", "vs")
- **update**: refresh prior research with new information ("latest on", "what changed", "update my notes on")

"Difference between A and B" is **compare**. "Research A and B" is **research** (parallel, not head-to-head).

**Q3 — What region and language?**
Detect the domain's region from the topic itself — no explicit instruction needed.
Apply language rules from strategies/search-protocol.md.

**Q4 — Are there existing files to work from?**
If the user references files, documents, or notes (e.g. "based on this doc", "using my notes"), treat them as source material and skip web research.

**Q5 — Where should the output go?**
- If user mentions a path or filename, save there.
- If user says "update" an existing report, read it first and add to it.
- Otherwise, default to context/[domain].md.

**Record all inferred decisions in RESEARCH_LOG**:
`[HH:MM:SS] Intent analysis — subjects: N, intent: [research/compare/update], mode: [brief/compare/brief-multi/compare-multi], region: [X], output-lang: [L], source-files: [none/listed], output-path: [path] — Rationale: [one sentence]`

## MODE ROUTING

| Subjects | Intent | Mode |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | research | **brief** — standard research report |
| 1 | compare | **brief** — 1 subject; frame internal tension in CORE_TENSION |
| 2 | research | **brief-multi** — shared report, each subject gets its own sub-sections |
| 2 | compare | **compare** — head-to-head using comparison.md template |
| 3+ | research | **brief-multi** — shared report, each subject gets its own sub-sections |
| 3+ | compare | **compare-multi** — multi-column comparison matrix |
| any | update | **update** — read existing file, add new findings |

### Mode: brief
Standard research report. Uses template: templates/decision-brief.md
Flow: SCOPE → COLLECT → SCORE → EXTRACT → OUTPUT

### Mode: compare (2 subjects, compare intent)
Head-to-head analysis. Uses template: templates/comparison.md
Collect evidence for each subject independently, then compare.
Flow: SCOPE → COLLECT (A) → COLLECT (B) → SCORE → COMPARE → OUTPUT

### Mode: brief-multi (2+ subjects, research intent)
Parallel research. Uses templates/decision-brief.md as base structure.
Shared SCOPE and CONSTRAINTS. Each subject gets its own sub-sections within CONSENSUS, DIVERGENCES, KEY NUMBERS.
Collect evidence for each subject independently.

### Mode: compare-multi (3+ subjects, compare intent)
Multi-way comparison. Extend comparison.md with N columns in the matrix.
Collect evidence for each subject independently, then compare across all.

### Mode: update (any, update intent)
Read the referenced existing report first.
Preserve sections that do not need updating.
Add new findings; mark updated content with [Updated: date].
Do not remove historical context.
Update DECISION_READINESS based on new information.

**Path resolution for update mode**:
- If user specifies an explicit path, use it.
- If user references a domain name (e.g. "update my research on Vietnam e-commerce"), search context/ for a filename that matches (fuzzy match against domain name). If one match found, use it. If multiple matches found, list them and ask the user to confirm. If no file found, ask: "No existing report found for [domain]. Start a fresh research report instead?"

### Mode: file-only (user provided source files, no web research requested)
When the user references existing files as source material:
Treat those files as the ONLY source — do NOT run web searches.
Cross-verify claims across files; flag contradictions.
Annotate each claim with [source: filename].
Mark sections with insufficient evidence as [WEAK: recommend: ___].

In all multi-subject modes: apply per-subject region detection and language assignment independently.
See search-protocol.md for per-subject language rules.

***

## EXECUTION STEPS

### STEP 1 — DEFINE SCOPE
→ Clarify what is inside this domain and what is outside
→ **Detect the domain region** (always inferred from topic — never requires explicit instruction):
  - If the topic inherently involves a specific country/region (e.g. "Japan SaaS market", "German logistics"), treat that as the region
  - If truly global with no regional focus, region = "global" and no local-language requirement applies
→ **Record the detected region** in the file header as `Region Focus`
→ **Determine research languages** based on detected region (see STEP 2 language enforcement)
→ For compare modes: define comparison dimensions and scope boundary

### STEP 2 — COLLECT EVIDENCE
Follow strategies/search-protocol.md for search protocol.
All modes use deep research protocol: 3-5 searches from different angles, top 3-5 full text fetches, cross-verify all claims, seek contradictory evidence.

Priority order for source types:
1. authoritative reports / primary materials
2. practitioner sources
3. credible public internet
4. user/community signals

**Search angles** (always use all 5):
- Angle 1: Direct/factual — "What is [domain]? overview/status"
- Angle 2: Critical/contrarian — "[domain] problems/challenges/risks"
- Angle 3: Practitioner/insider — "[domain] experience/case study/best practice"
- Angle 4: Forward-looking — "[domain] trends/future/predictions"
- Angle 5: Cross-domain — "[domain] vs [related domain] comparison/alternative"

**Language enforcement** (hard rule — applies to all modes):
- When a region is detected in STEP 1 (not "global"), angles 1 and 2 MUST use the official local language.
- Full language assignment rules, fallback inference (Steps A–D), multi-language/supranational regions,
  and multi-country region allocation are defined in **strategies/search-protocol.md → Search Language and Region**.
- Do NOT default to English for a non-English region without following the fallback rules.
- Record the actual search language for each angle in RESEARCH_LOG.

**Cross-verification**:
- Any claim used in CONSENSUS or DIVERGENCES must be verified from at least 2 independent sources
- If only 1 source found, mark evidence as LOW and note "single source"
- Seek contradictory evidence actively — do not stop at confirming sources
- In compare modes: collect evidence for each subject independently using the same deep protocol

**Scarce information handling**:
- If all 5 search angles return fewer than 3 valid sources total, the domain is "information-scarce"
- Mark the file's information confidence as LOW
- In SCOPE, note: "Information-scarce domain — insufficient search results for high-confidence judgment"
- Prioritize what few sources exist for CONSENSUS, move most claims to DIVERGENCES or [UNKNOWN]
- In DECISION_READINESS, set confidence index ≤ 3

### STEP 3 — SCORE EVIDENCE
See references/evidence-scoring.md for detailed criteria.
For each key claim, assign:
- HIGH = repeated across strong or primary sources (2+ independent authoritative sources)
- MEDIUM = plausible, partially supported, limited contradiction
- LOW = anecdotal, emerging, weakly verified, or single source only

### STEP 4 — EXTRACT CONSENSUS
Max 5 items.
Only include facts that can affect a decision.
Each item must have at least one source reference.

### STEP 5 — EXTRACT DIVERGENCES
Max 5 items.
For each divergence, preserve both sides with direct reasoning.
Do not resolve disagreement unless evidence decisively closes it.
Each side must reference its source.
**Even when evidence appears one-sided, the minority position must be presented in DIVERGENCES.**
Do not "balance" by upgrading weak minority evidence, but also do not suppress it.
Asymmetric evidence quality is a valid finding — present it honestly.

### STEP 5.5 — OPTIONAL SECTIONS (include when relevant)
These three sections are **not always required** — include them when the evidence and topic warrant it.
Record in RESEARCH_LOG which optional sections were included and why.

**A. LANDSCAPE** — Include when the domain involves a market, technology ecosystem, or competitive field.
Synthesize the competitive/ecosystem structure from evidence already collected:
- Key players: who are the main actors, what is their positioning
- Market structure: fragmented / consolidated / duopoly / emerging
- Notable recent moves: acquisitions, launches, exits, regulatory actions (with dates and sources)
- Do NOT list players without evidence — if a player is mentioned but not researched, omit or mark [UNVERIFIED]

**B. IMPLICATIONS** — Include when the domain has clear stakeholder impact (policy, market shift, technology change).
For each relevant stakeholder group, state the direct consequence and one second-order effect:
- Keep to 2-4 stakeholder groups maximum
- Each implication must be traceable to a CONSENSUS or DIVERGENCES item
- Avoid generic statements ("this will change everything") — be specific

**C. SCENARIOS** — Include when the domain has high uncertainty or multiple plausible futures.
Define 2-3 scenarios based on the key variable identified in CORE_TENSION:
- Base case: most likely path given current trajectory
- Upside / opportunity scenario: what would need to be true
- Downside / risk scenario: what would need to be true
- The key variable that drives divergence between scenarios (should map to an OPEN_QUESTION)

### STEP 6 — EXTRACT FAILED_PATHS
What has already been tried and failed?
Why did it fail?
Under what conditions would it fail again?
Cite sources for failure evidence.

### STEP 7 — IDENTIFY CORE_TENSION
Compress the entire domain into one irreducible contradiction.
One sentence only. One main-subject-predicate structure. Keep it tight — expansion belongs in other sections.
Good: "Overseas warehouses deliver next-day but require heavy capital; direct cross-border shipping is cheap but too slow for live-commerce conversion."
Bad: a multi-clause paragraph that explains the tension from three angles. (Over-expanded)

### STEP 8 — IDENTIFY CONSTRAINTS
Separate:
- hard constraints (physical, legal, irreversible)
- soft constraints (economic, social, potentially changeable)
- self-imposed constraints (assumptions, preferences, organizational)
Do not mix them.

### STEP 9 — OPEN QUESTIONS
List 2-3 questions whose answers would most change what to do next.

### STEP 10 — DECISION READINESS
State:
- biggest evidence gap
- what can still be decided despite uncertainty
- what must not be decided yet
- **next concrete action** (1-2 specific steps the reader can take immediately)
- decision confidence index (0-10)
- time sensitivity (high / medium / low)
- reversibility (reversible / partially reversible / irreversible)

### STEP 11 — COMPILE SOURCES
Aggregate all sources referenced throughout the document.
Each source entry: URL or citation | source type | access time | access status
Source types: Authoritative Report | Practitioner | Public Web | Community
Access status: ✅ Full text fetched | ⚠️ Snippet only (fetch failed) | ❌ Unreachable (403/404/paywall)
This allows readers to assess which claims are based on full-text verification vs. snippets only.

### STEP 12 — COMPILE RESEARCH LOG
Track the research process for reproducibility:
- [HH:MM:SS] Intent analysis — all inferred decisions (see SEMANTIC INTENT ANALYSIS)
- [HH:MM:SS] Optional sections included: [LANDSCAPE / IMPLICATIONS / SCENARIOS / none] — [rationale]
- [HH:MM:SS] Search: "keyword" → N results
- [HH:MM:SS] Full text fetch: URL → key finding / FAILED (reason)
- [HH:MM:SS] Cross-verify: fact X → confirmed / disputed
Use second-precision timestamps for reproducibility.

Load the appropriate template at output time. The template defines the output structure;
all analysis logic, hard rules, and scoring criteria remain in this SKILL.md.

**Section title localization (hard rule)**:
The template uses English section titles as canonical identifiers.
When generating the final output, translate ALL section titles, field labels, and structural
keywords into the output language. Do NOT leave English titles in a non-English report.

## OUTPUT PERSISTENCE
After generating the output:
1. Determine the output path from SEMANTIC INTENT ANALYSIS Q5 (user-mentioned path, or default context/[domain].md)
2. Print confirmation: "✅ Research output saved to: [path]"
3. Before writing, check if the target file already exists
4. If file exists AND the intent is NOT "update":
   - STOP and ask the user: "File [path] already exists. Overwrite, append, or cancel?"
   - "Overwrite" → replace the entire file
   - "Append" → add new content after existing content
   - "Cancel" → abort, do not write
   - Only proceed if user explicitly confirms
5. If file does not exist: create parent directories and write normally
